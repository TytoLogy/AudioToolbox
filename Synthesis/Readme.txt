Audio Toolbox -> Synthesis

Functions here are used to generate noise, tones, clicks of various sorts.

in general:

- functions with 'mono' in them synthesize single channel stimuli
- functions with 'headphone' synthesize dichotic (2 channel) stimuli
- most synthesis functions can generate "pre calibrated" stimuli if
calibration data are given to them

Please note that some functions here are redundant.  
pruning is in progress, but sporadic...
